Several approaches can resolve this issue.  First, verify that all libraries are compatible with your current React Native version. Consult the library's documentation for compatibility details.  If an update is available, install it using npm or yarn.  If the library is outdated or no longer maintained, consider finding a suitable alternative library that provides similar functionality.  If you are comfortable, you might attempt to fix the bugs in the original library directly, but carefully review the license and understand the implications before doing so.  For example, you might need to fork the library and make the necessary changes.  Always prioritize using officially supported and actively maintained libraries to minimize the risk of incompatibility issues.
