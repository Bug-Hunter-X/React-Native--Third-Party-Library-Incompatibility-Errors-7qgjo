This error occurs when you are using a third-party library in your React Native project and that library is not compatible with the version of React Native you are using. This can lead to unexpected behavior, crashes, or build failures. For example, if you use a library that is only compatible with React Native 0.60 and you are using React Native 0.68, you will likely encounter this error.  Another case might be that the library has bugs or dependencies that are not properly managed. This can be more common for lesser-known or less-maintained libraries.
