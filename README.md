This repository demonstrates a common error in React Native development: incompatibility issues with third-party libraries. The `ThirdPartyLibError.js` file showcases a scenario where an outdated or buggy library causes unexpected behavior or crashes. The `ThirdPartyLibSolution.js` file provides a solution by either updating to a compatible library version, using an alternative library, or fixing the bugs within the library if possible.  The error often manifests as runtime exceptions or build errors, depending on the nature of the incompatibility.
